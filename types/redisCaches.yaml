      The Radius.Data/redisCaches Resource Type deploys Redis, an in-memory, key/value store used as an application cache.
      
      To deploy a new Redis cache, add a RedisCaches resource to the application definition Bicep file.   

      ```
      extension radius
      param environment string
        
      resource myApplication 'Radius.Core/applications@2025-08-01-preview' = { ... }
        
      resource redis 'Radius.Data/redisCaches@2025-08-01-preview' = {
        name: 'redis'
        properties: {
          environment: environment
        }
      }
      ```

      When `capacity` is not set, the value is assumed to be `S`(Small) in Recipes.

      To connect your application to the Redis Cache, establish a connection from the container to the Redis Cache as shown below. Once connected, all Redis Cache properties are automatically injected as environment variables into the container. 
      
      ```
      resource myContainer 'Radius.Compute/containers@2025-08-01-preview' = {
        name: 'myContainer'
        properties: {
          environment: environment
          application: myApplication.id
          containers: {
            frontend: {
              image: 'frontend:1.25' 
            }
          }
          connections: {
            redis:{
              source: redis.id
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```
